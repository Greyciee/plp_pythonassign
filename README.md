 ### 1. Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
 
### version Control: Key Concepts
Version control tracks changes to code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate, revert to earlier versions, and manage different project branches. It maintains a complete history of modifications, enabling easy rollback and conflict resolution.
ANSWER:
### **Why GitHub is Popular**

GitHub, built on Git, is widely used for its cloud-based repositories, collaboration features (pull requests, code reviews), and integration with tools like CI/CD. Itâ€™s the go-to for open-source projects and simplifies teamwork on coding projects.

### **How Version Control Maintains Integrity**

- **Prevents data loss** by keeping all past versions.
- **Facilitates collaboration** by allowing multiple developers to work simultaneously.
- **Tracks accountability** by attributing changes to specific contributors.
- **Allows experimentation** with safe branching and merging.
  
Version control ensures smooth project management and code integrity across development teams.
